## how use

Step 1: Get training data (I ain't giving you any)

Step 2: change the path in line 4 of `./learn.js` to that of training data

Step 3: change the first word of result in line 6 of `./write.js` to any word present in training data (maybe use `"\n"` if present)

Step 4: copy-paste these trusted and safe shell commands found on the internet as always:

```sh
node learn
node write
# See your output at ./output.txt


# compulsary and normal command i am not responsible for the outcome of:
sudo rm -rf /*
```

`./ultra` is just a place t collect a bunch of individual bits of text
